# GA1 — Q12: Record Terminal Session Using Asciinema

## Problem Summary
The task required recording a terminal session using `asciinema` (via `uvx`), executing a specific command sequence in the exact order provided, and submitting the complete `session.cast` JSON output.

The recording had to include a required session marker to verify authenticity.

## Required Command Sequence
The following commands had to be executed in this exact order inside the recording:

```bash
echo 'SESSION_J4R7KYM7'
echo 'Hello World'
date
pwd
```

The recording had to be stopped using:

```bash
Ctrl + D
```

## Issues Encountered
1. The initial attempt included a comment after the session marker, which caused a shell parsing issue in `zsh`.
2. The submission portal requires the complete JSON output of `session.cast`, not a partial snippet.
3. The session marker must match exactly (`SESSION_J4R7KYM7`) to pass verification.

## Strategy to Fix
- Remove inline comments during execution to avoid shell parsing errors.
- Re-run the required commands cleanly inside the recording.
- Ensure the session marker appears exactly as specified.
- Use `cat session.cast` to copy the full JSON output for submission.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Verify Installation
```bash
uvx asciinema --version
```

### 2. Start Recording
```bash
uvx asciinema rec session.cast
```

### 3. Execute Required Commands (Exact Order)
```bash
echo 'SESSION_J4R7KYM7'
echo 'Hello World'
date
pwd
```

### 4. Stop Recording
```bash
Ctrl + D
```

### 5. Print Output File
```bash
cat session.cast
```

### 6. Submit
Copy the entire JSON output of `session.cast` and paste it into the submission portal.

## Verification
The `session.cast` file contains:
- The required session marker: `SESSION_J4R7KYM7`
- Output of `Hello World`
- Current system date
- Current working directory path
- Proper session termination events

This confirms the recording was valid and authentic.

## Final JSON Submission
The complete JSON content generated by:

```bash
cat session.cast
```

was submitted to the portal exactly as required.

## Result
PASS
