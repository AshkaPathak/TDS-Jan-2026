# GA1 — Q13: GitHub Copilot CLI (Asciinema Recording)

## Problem Summary
The task required using GitHub Copilot CLI to answer a question inside an `asciinema` recording. The recording had to include a required session marker and the Copilot prompt, and the full `session.cast` JSON had to be submitted to the portal.

## Required Command Sequence
The following commands had to be executed in this exact order inside the recording:

```bash
echo 'COPILOT_A9NB7Z66'
gh copilot -p "How many sides does a hexagon have?"
```

## Issues Identified
1. `gh` (GitHub CLI) was not installed initially, causing `zsh: command not found: gh`.
2. The `gh copilot ask` syntax was invalid for this Copilot CLI version, requiring the `-p/--prompt` option.
3. `session.cast` already existed from Q12, so a new output file name was required to avoid overwriting.

## Strategy to Fix
- Install GitHub CLI (`gh`) and authenticate.
- Use non-interactive Copilot CLI mode with `-p` (prompt).
- Record to a new cast file (`session_q13.cast`) to avoid conflicts with earlier recordings.
- Submit the complete cast JSON content by copying the output of `cat session_q13.cast`.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Install and Authenticate GitHub CLI
```bash
brew install gh
gh auth login
gh auth status
```

### 2. Verify Copilot CLI Works (Outside Recording)
```bash
gh copilot -p "How many sides does a hexagon have?"
```

### 3. Record the Required Session
```bash
uvx asciinema rec session_q13.cast
```

### 4. Execute Required Commands (Exact Order)
```bash
echo 'COPILOT_A9NB7Z66'
gh copilot -p "How many sides does a hexagon have?"
```

### 5. Stop Recording
```bash
Ctrl + D
```

### 6. Print Output File for Submission
```bash
cat session_q13.cast
```

## Verification
The recording output contains:
- The required marker: `COPILOT_A9NB7Z66`
- The Copilot prompt: `How many sides does a hexagon have?`
- Copilot response: `A hexagon has 6 sides.`
- Proper session termination (`completed.`)

## Final JSON Submission
The complete JSON content generated by:

```bash
cat session_q13.cast
```

was pasted into the portal as the final submission.

## Result
PASS
