# GA2 — Graded Assignment 2

This folder contains my **question-wise attempts** for Tools in Data Science (TDS) — GA2.

## Structure

- Each question will have a dedicated markdown writeup:
  - `q01_*.md`
  - `q02_*.md`
  - ...

- Any code/artifacts required for a specific question will live alongside its writeup in a subfolder:
  - `q0X_<topic>/`

## Standard Writeup Template (used per question)

1. Problem Summary  
2. Constraints / Validation Requirements  
3. Strategy  
4. Implementation (commands/code/config)  
5. Verification (how I confirmed correctness)  
6. GitHub Steps (exact steps to commit/push)
